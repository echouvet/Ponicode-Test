# Ponicode-Test
Technical test for Ponicode CDI

This script seems to work flawlessly on small data sets. However it takes too long to find the results for the given datasets: roller_coaster.hard and roller_coaster.harder 

The file input.txt is the simple testcase given by the Code In Game excercise.

# To run this script: 
1) clone the repository
2) set the value of the filename variable at the top of rollercoaster.ts
3) run the rollercoaster.ts script
